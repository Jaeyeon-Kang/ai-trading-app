### Issue: Celery Worker/Beat Containers in Restart Loop

- **Symptom**: `docker compose ps` shows `celery_worker` and `celery_beat` services are constantly restarting.
- **Diagnosis**: Checked container logs using `docker compose logs celery_worker`.
- **Root Cause**: A `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block` was found in `app/jobs/scheduler.py`. A `try` block for publishing to Redis was missing its corresponding `except` block. This syntax error prevented the Celery application from loading, causing the containers to crash immediately upon start.
- **Resolution**: Added the missing `except Exception as e:` block to correctly handle potential errors during the Redis publish operation.

### Action: System Recovery

1.  **Linting**: Confirmed the syntax error using the `ruff` linter.
2.  **Code Fix**: Applied the fix to `app/jobs/scheduler.py`.
3.  **Documentation**: Documented the issue and resolution in this log file.
4.  **Commit**: Committed the code and documentation changes to the repository.
5.  **Rebuild & Restart**: Performed a no-cache build (`docker compose build --no-cache`) and restarted all services (`docker compose up -d`).
6.  **Verification**: Confirmed all containers are in a stable `running` state.
